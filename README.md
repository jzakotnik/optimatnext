# Optimat Next - a simple kitchen dashboard with relevant data 

## What is it about?

I wanted to have a simple dashboard in the kitchen displaying relevant information for the family life - both with home related information and stuff like calendar and missed calls. And it should run on a small screen that doesn't consume a lot of energy.

## Why Optimat, there's Home Assistant and others?

Sure, there are other solutions, but for me they were too heavyweight and not custom
isable enough.

## How to install and configure
This needs more explanation, but the quick way is:
- Clone the repo and switch to the cloned folder
- Copy `.env_example` into `.env` and update all information
- Run `npm install`
- Run  `npm run dev` and check if it's all working
- Run `npm run build` and let `pm2` manage the restarts etc
